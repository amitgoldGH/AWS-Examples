In the case where you configured a aws profile on the machine you're running this from and NOT using the aws default

Can either add to main.tf in the provider object the field: profile = "myawsprofile"
so:

provider "aws" {
    region  = "us-east-1"
    profile = "myawsprofile"
}

or you can define it for that specific terminal session:
export AWS_PROFILE="myawsprofile"
export AWS_REGION="us-east-1"
terraform apply

This is if you don't want your aws profile name in a file uploaded to the repo.
